# terminal-chess-6
## A Rust implementation.

### tldr;

  A terminal based chess game, written in rust. A chess engine is planned to work in tandem.

## Short Roadmap (For Contributors)

  Written in rust. Class based, using the struct/impl format. Modules will work outside of the scope of the project, though some are co-dependant.
  No game logic has been implemented yet. Only debugging functionality.
  Main focus is the chess engine, so the game logic and i/o will be built around future compatibility.
  Built via composition.
  Fen parser to load games at certain states for analysis.

## Maybe?

  The concept of online play is not that far fetched, but it is not a plan until the game i/o (not the engine) is stable.
